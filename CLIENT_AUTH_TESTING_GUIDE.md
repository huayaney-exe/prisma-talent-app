# Client Authentication System - Testing Guide

## ‚úÖ What Was Built (YC MVP - 60 minutes)

**Goal**: Admin creates client ‚Üí Client gets magic link ‚Üí Client logs in ‚Üí Client can create positions

**Architecture**: Lean, production-ready, zero custom infrastructure

---

## üß™ How to Test End-to-End

### Step 1: Create a Test Lead (Admin)

1. **Go to Landing Page**: http://localhost:3000/
2. **Fill contact form** with test data:
   - Name: Test Client
   - Email: YOUR_REAL_EMAIL@gmail.com ‚ö†Ô∏è (use real email to receive magic link!)
   - Company: Test Company Inc
   - Intent: Hiring
3. **Submit** ‚Üí Lead created in database

### Step 2: Approve Lead (Admin)

1. **Login as admin**: http://localhost:3000/admin/login
   - Email: huayaney.exe@gmail.com
   - Password: Your admin password
2. **Go to Lead Management**: http://localhost:3000/admin/leads
3. **Find your test lead** ‚Üí Click "Aprobar"
4. **Lead status changes** to "approved"

### Step 3: Create Client Account (Admin)

1. **On the approved lead**, click **"üéØ Crear Cliente"** button
2. **Confirm** the popup
3. **Supabase sends magic link** to client email automatically
4. **Success message**: "Cuenta de cliente creada. Email de invitaci√≥n enviado."

### Step 4: Check Your Email (Client)

1. **Open your email inbox** (the one you used in the form)
2. **Look for email from Supabase** (subject: "Confirm your signup")
   - Check spam folder if not in inbox
3. **Click the magic link** in the email
4. **You'll be redirected** to http://localhost:3000/client/dashboard

### Step 5: Client Dashboard (Client)

1. **You're now logged in** as a client
2. **See your company info** and dashboard
3. **Try clicking**: "Ir al Formulario HR"
4. **HR Form opens with company banner** ‚úÖ

### Step 6: HR Form Auto-Fill (Client)

1. **Company banner visible** at top: "üè¢ Creando posici√≥n para: [Company Name]"
2. **Fill out the position form** normally
3. **Submit the form**
4. **Position created** - automatically linked to your company
5. **Verify in database** (see SQL below)

---

## üîç What to Verify

### Database Changes

**After Step 3** (Create Client), verify in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Check company was created
SELECT * FROM companies
WHERE primary_contact_email = 'YOUR_EMAIL@gmail.com';

-- Check auth user was created
SELECT id, email, created_at FROM auth.users
WHERE email = 'YOUR_EMAIL@gmail.com';

-- Check link between company and auth user
SELECT
  c.company_name,
  c.primary_contact_email,
  c.primary_contact_auth_id,
  u.email as auth_email
FROM companies c
LEFT JOIN auth.users u ON c.primary_contact_auth_id = u.id
WHERE c.primary_contact_email = 'YOUR_EMAIL@gmail.com';
```

**Expected**: All 3 queries return data, company has `primary_contact_auth_id` matching auth.users.id

### Position Creation Verification

**After Step 6** (Client creates position), verify position is linked to client company:

```sql
-- Check position was created with correct company_id
SELECT
  p.position_code,
  p.position_name,
  p.company_id,
  c.company_name,
  c.primary_contact_email
FROM positions p
JOIN companies c ON p.company_id = c.id
WHERE c.primary_contact_email = 'YOUR_EMAIL@gmail.com'
ORDER BY p.created_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

**Expected**: Position shows with matching company_id and company_name

### Authentication Flow

**Client Login** (http://localhost:3000/client/login):
1. Enter email
2. Click "Enviar Magic Link"
3. Check email for link
4. Click link ‚Üí Logged in
5. No password needed ‚úÖ

**Client Dashboard** (http://localhost:3000/client/dashboard):
1. Shows company name in header
2. Shows welcome message
3. Shows 4 cards: Create Position, My Positions, Company Info, Support
4. Can click "Ir al Formulario HR"

**HR Form Auto-Fill** (http://localhost:3000/hr-form):
1. Shows company banner: "üè¢ Creando posici√≥n para: [Company Name]"
2. Banner explains position will be linked to company
3. Form submits with company_id automatically
4. Position created is visible only to that client ‚úÖ

**Protected Routes**:
- Try accessing `/client/dashboard` without login ‚Üí Redirects to `/client/login` ‚úÖ
- Try accessing `/admin` as client ‚Üí Shows "Acceso Denegado" ‚úÖ

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Magic Link Email Not Received

**Possible Causes**:
1. Email in spam folder
2. Supabase email not configured properly
3. Wrong email entered

**Fix**:
```sql
-- Check if auth user was created
SELECT * FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'YOUR_EMAIL@gmail.com';

-- If user exists but no email received, manually get magic link:
-- Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí Users
-- Find the user ‚Üí Click "Send Magic Link"
```

### Issue: "Error al crear cuenta de cliente"

**Check Browser Console** for error message:
- "User already exists" ‚Üí Use different email or delete existing user
- "Permission denied" ‚Üí Check admin is logged in
- "Invalid email" ‚Üí Check email format

**Debug**:
```javascript
// In browser console after login as admin
const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.admin.inviteUserByEmail(
  'test@example.com',
  { data: { role: 'client' } }
)
console.log({ data, error })
```

### Issue: Client Can't Access Dashboard

**Check** in browser console:
```javascript
// Should return client company
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('companies')
  .select('*')
  .eq('primary_contact_auth_id', (await supabase.auth.getUser()).data.user?.id)
console.log(data)
```

**If empty**: Auth user not linked to company
**Fix**: Run SQL to link them:
```sql
UPDATE companies
SET primary_contact_auth_id = 'AUTH_USER_ID_HERE'
WHERE primary_contact_email = 'CLIENT_EMAIL@example.com';
```

## üéØ Next Steps After Testing

### Immediate (This Week)
1. Test with 1-2 real clients
2. Gather feedback on dashboard UX
3. Monitor email delivery success rate

2. **Client Positions Page**: Show list of their positions at `/client/positions`
3. **Email Templates**: Custom branded invitation emails

### Future Enhancements
1. Client can view applicants for their positions
2. Client can provide feedback on candidates
3. Client analytics dashboard
4. Multi-user support (invite team members)

## üîê Security Notes

**What's Secure** ‚úÖ:
- Magic links expire after 1 hour
- Supabase handles token generation/validation
- RLS policies enforce company isolation
- No passwords to steal/leak
- Production-grade authentication

**What's Not Yet Implemented** ‚ö†Ô∏è:
- Email verification (Supabase handles this)
- Rate limiting on magic link requests
- Audit logging of client actions
- Two-factor authentication

**For Production**:
- Configure custom email domain (not @supabase.co)
- Set up monitoring for failed auth attempts
- Add rate limiting on invitation creation
- Implement session timeout policies
