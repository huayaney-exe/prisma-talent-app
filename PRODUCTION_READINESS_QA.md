```
1. Public user submits lead form
   ‚Üì
2. Lead stored in database (status: 'pending')
   ‚Üì
3. Admin views in /admin/leads
   ‚Üì
4. Admin approves lead

## Production Blockers Found

### üî¥ BLOCKER #1: Public HR Form Company Association
**Location**: Flow 3 - Position Creation (Public)
**Problem**: Public HR form has no way to determine company_id
**Current Code**:
```typescript
// positionService.ts:41
if (!finalCompanyId) {
  throw new Error('Company ID is required. Please log in or contact support.')
}
```

**Impact**: Public HR forms will fail with error
**Options**:
1. **Remove public HR form** - Only allow authenticated clients
2. **Add company_id to URL** - `/hr-form?company=xxx` (security risk)
3. **Use subdomain** - `company-slug.getprisma.io/hr-form`
4. **Require minimal auth** - Magic link before HR form

**Recommendation**: Option 1 - Remove public HR form for now

---

### üî¥ BLOCKER #2: Business Form RLS Policies - WILL FAIL
**Location**: Flow 4 - Business Leader Form
**Problem**: Business form is public (unauthenticated) but tries to update positions table
**Status**: ‚ùå **CONFIRMED BLOCKER** - No public update policy exists

**Current RLS Policies on positions table**:
```sql
-- From database/migrations/006_rls_policies_update.sql
-- Lines 191-214

-- ‚úÖ HR users can insert (authenticated)
CREATE POLICY "positions_hr_insert" ON positions FOR INSERT...

-- ‚úÖ HR users can update (authenticated)
CREATE POLICY "positions_hr_update" ON positions FOR UPDATE...

-- ‚úÖ Prisma admins can update (authenticated)
CREATE POLICY "positions_admin_update" ON positions FOR UPDATE...

-- ‚ùå NO PUBLIC UPDATE POLICY EXISTS
```

**Impact**: Business leaders clicking email link will get RLS permission denied error when trying to submit business form

**Solution Required**: Add new RLS policy for public business form updates
```sql
-- Allow public updates ONLY for leader_completed workflow stage
CREATE POLICY "positions_business_form_update" ON positions
  FOR UPDATE
  TO anon
  USING (workflow_stage = 'hr_completed')
  WITH CHECK (workflow_stage = 'leader_completed');
```

**Migration Required**: Create `031_business_form_public_update.sql`

---

### üü† HIGH PRIORITY #3: Email System Verification
**Location**: Flows 1, 2, 4
**Problem**: Email triggers need production testing
**Tests Required**:
1. Lead conversion ‚Üí Client receives magic link
2. HR form submission ‚Üí Leader receives business form link
3. Leader form completion ‚Üí Admin receives notification

**Verification**:
```sql
-- Check email_communications table
SELECT
  email_type,
  recipient_email,
  sent_at,
  status,
  created_at
FROM email_communications
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

---

### üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY #4: Frontend Environment Variables
**Location**: All flows with external URLs
**Problem**: Email links need correct production URLs

**Required Variables**:
```bash
# frontend/.env.production
VITE_APP_URL=https://app.getprisma.io  # Must be production URL
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://vhjjibfblrkyfzcukqwa.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJ...
```

**Database Config**:
```sql
-- Check app_config table
SELECT key, value FROM app_config WHERE key LIKE '%url%';
```

---

### üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY #5: File Upload Storage
**Location**: Flow 6 - Job Applications
**Problem**: Need Supabase Storage bucket configured

**Required**:
- Bucket: `resumes` (public read)
- Bucket: `portfolios` (public read)
- RLS policies for uploads

**Test**:
```typescript
// Check if bucket exists
const { data: buckets } = await supabase.storage.listBuckets()
console.log('Buckets:', buckets)
```

## Risk Assessment

### üî¥ CRITICAL BLOCKERS (Must Fix Before Production)

#### BLOCKER #1: Public HR Form Company Association
- **Impact**: Public HR forms will throw error "Company ID is required"
- **Severity**: CRITICAL - Breaks entire public form submission flow
- **Affected Flow**: Flow 3 - Position Creation (Public HR Form)
- **Estimated Fix Time**: 30 minutes (remove public form route or implement subdomain strategy)
- **Recommendation**: Remove public HR form for MVP, require client authentication

#### BLOCKER #2: Business Form RLS Policy Missing ‚ö†Ô∏è NEW FINDING
- **Impact**: Business leaders cannot submit business form (RLS permission denied)
- **Severity**: CRITICAL - Breaks core position workflow (Flow 4)
- **Affected Flow**: Flow 4 - Business Leader Completes Position
- **Estimated Fix Time**: 15 minutes (create migration 031 with public update policy)
- **Required Action**: Create `031_business_form_public_update.sql` immediately

### üü† HIGH RISK (Should Fix Before Production)
3. **Email System Verification** - Critical for all workflows, needs production testing
4. **Frontend Production URLs** - Wrong URLs break magic links in emails
5. **File Upload Storage** - Applicants can't attach resumes without configured buckets

### üü¢ LOW RISK (Monitor in Production)
6. Position code validation error handling
7. User-facing error messages clarity
8. Loading states and UX polish
9. Analytics and monitoring setup

## Next Steps - Production Deployment Roadmap

### Phase 1: CRITICAL BLOCKERS (Required Before Any Deployment)

1. ‚úÖ **Create Migration 031** - Business Form Public Update Policy (15 min)
   - File: `database/migrations/031_business_form_public_update.sql`
   - Add RLS policy allowing anon role to update positions (hr_completed ‚Üí leader_completed)
   - Apply via Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor

2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Resolve BLOCKER #1** - Public HR Form Strategy (30 min)
   - **Option A (RECOMMENDED)**: Remove public HR form route, require authentication
   - **Option B**: Implement subdomain-based company detection
   - **Option C**: Add company_id as URL parameter (security concerns)
   - Decision needed before proceeding

### Phase 2: HIGH PRIORITY FIXES (Before Production Launch)

3. **Email System Verification** (1 hour)
   - Test lead conversion ‚Üí client invitation email
   - Test HR form ‚Üí business leader notification
   - Test leader form ‚Üí admin notification
   - Verify all emails contain correct production URLs

4. **Configure Production URLs** (30 min)
   - Update `frontend/.env.production` with production domain
   - Update database `app_config` table with production URLs
   - Verify Edge Functions use production URLs for email links

5. **Create Storage Buckets** (20 min)
   - Create `resumes` bucket (public read, authenticated write)
   - Create `portfolios` bucket (public read, authenticated write)
   - Configure RLS policies for file uploads

### Phase 3: INTEGRATION TESTING (2-3 hours)

6. **Execute Complete Testing Checklist**
   - Run all 7 critical user flows end-to-end
   - Verify authentication flows work correctly
   - Test all email triggers fire properly
   - Validate file uploads work
   - Check admin candidate review workflow

### Phase 4: DEPLOYMENT (If All Tests Pass)

7. **Deploy to Production**
   - Verify all blockers resolved
   - Run final smoke tests
   - Monitor error logs for 24 hours post-deployment

---

## Production Readiness Summary

### Current Status: üî¥ NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION

**Overall Assessment**: System has **2 CRITICAL BLOCKERS** that will cause system failures in production. Core workflows (public HR form submission, business leader form completion) will fail.

### Blockers Breakdown:
- üî¥ **2 Critical Blockers** - System will fail
- üü† **3 High Priority Issues** - Should fix before launch
- üü¢ **4 Low Priority Issues** - Monitor in production

### Estimated Time to Production Ready:
- **Minimum**: 2 hours (fix blockers only, skip high priority)
- **Recommended**: 5-6 hours (fix all blockers + high priority + basic testing)
- **Comprehensive**: 8-10 hours (fix all issues + complete integration testing)

### Recommendation:
**DO NOT deploy to production** until both critical blockers are resolved. The business form RLS policy issue will cause immediate failures in the core position workflow.

---

## Status: ‚úÖ ANALYSIS COMPLETE

**QA Analysis Completed**: All 7 critical user flows analyzed, 2 production blockers identified.

**Next Action Required**: Create migration 031 for business form RLS policy, then decide on public HR form strategy.
