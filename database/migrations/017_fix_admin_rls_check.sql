-- Migration: Fix admin RLS check to use prisma_admins table
-- Date: 2025-10-10
-- Purpose: Properly identify admin users via prisma_admins table instead of JWT role

-- =============================================================================
-- PROBLEM: Admin users identified by prisma_admins table, not JWT role
-- - Previous migration checked for auth.jwt()->>'role' = 'service_role'
-- - But frontend uses anon key with authenticated role
-- - Need to check prisma_admins table instead
-- =============================================================================

-- Drop the service_role based policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "admin_full_access_companies" ON companies;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "admin_full_access_hr_users" ON hr_users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "admin_full_access_positions" ON positions;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "admin_full_access_job_descriptions" ON job_descriptions;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "admin_full_access_applicants" ON applicants;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "admin_full_access_application_activities" ON application_activities;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "admin_full_access_email_communications" ON email_communications;
