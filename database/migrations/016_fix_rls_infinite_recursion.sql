-- Migration: Fix RLS infinite recursion and add admin bypass
-- Date: 2025-10-10
-- Purpose: Fix circular reference in RLS policies and allow Prisma admins to bypass tenant isolation

-- =============================================================================
-- PROBLEM: Infinite recursion in RLS policies
-- - companies policy queries hr_users
-- - hr_users policy queries hr_users (circular!)
-- - Admin users have no hr_users record, causing all queries to fail
--
-- SOLUTION:
-- 1. Add admin bypass policies (service_role can access everything)
-- 2. Fix hr_users policy to avoid self-reference
-- 3. Use proper auth checks for admins vs clients
-- =============================================================================

-- Drop existing problematic policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "company_access" ON companies;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "tenant_isolation" ON hr_users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "tenant_isolation" ON positions;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "tenant_isolation" ON job_descriptions;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "tenant_isolation" ON applicants;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "tenant_isolation" ON application_activities;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "tenant_isolation" ON email_communications;

-- ADMIN BYPASS POLICIES (for Prisma staff using service_role key)
