## What Was Fixed

### Issue 1: Missing `auth_user_id` Column
**Problem**: Migration 006 expected `auth_user_id` in `hr_users` table
**Solution**: Simplified RLS policies to use email-based matching for MVP

### Issue 2: Duplicate `applicant_count` Column
**Problem**: Migration 010 view tried to create duplicate column
**Solution**: Renamed calculated column to `calculated_applicant_count`

### Issue 3: Storage Policy Comments Permission Error
**Problem**: Migration 011 couldn't comment on storage policies
**Solution**: Commented out the storage policy comments

### Issue 4: Sample Data Column Mismatch
**Problem**: Migration 004 had mismatched INSERT columns
**Solution**: Skipped sample data migration (not critical for production)

## Admin Configuration Required

### 1. Update Default Admin Email

**CRITICAL**: Change the default admin email before production use

```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
UPDATE prisma_admins
SET email = 'your-email@getprisma.io',
    full_name = 'Your Name'
WHERE email = 'admin@getprisma.io';
```

### 2. Create Additional Admins (Optional)

```sql
-- Add more admin users
INSERT INTO prisma_admins (email, full_name, role, permissions)
VALUES (
  'admin2@getprisma.io',
  'Second Admin',
  'admin',
  '{
    "can_enroll_clients": true,
    "can_publish_positions": true,
    "can_qualify_candidates": true,
    "can_manage_admins": false
  }'::jsonb
);
```

### 3. Link Admins to Supabase Auth (When Ready)

```sql
-- After admin creates Supabase Auth account, link it
UPDATE prisma_admins
SET auth_user_id = 'supabase-auth-user-id'
WHERE email = 'admin@getprisma.io';
```

## Testing Checklist

### Database Connectivity
- [ ] Frontend can connect to Supabase (verify VITE_SUPABASE_URL)
- [ ] Backend can connect to Supabase (verify SUPABASE_URL)
- [ ] Anon key working for public operations
- [ ] Service role key working for admin operations

### Lead Form Testing
```bash
# Test lead submission (should work)
curl -X POST https://vhjjibfblrkyfzcukqwa.supabase.co/rest/v1/leads \
  -H "apikey: YOUR_ANON_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "contact_name": "Test User",
    "contact_email": "test@example.com",
    "company_name": "Test Company",
    "intent": "hiring"
  }'

# Verify in Supabase Dashboard
# Dashboard > Table Editor > leads
```

### Admin Login Testing
```bash
# Test admin authentication
# 1. Visit frontend admin login page
# 2. Sign up with admin@getprisma.io (or your admin email)
# 3. Complete Supabase Auth signup
# 4. Verify can access admin dashboard
```

### RLS Policy Testing
```sql
-- Test as anonymous user (should work)
SET ROLE anon;
SELECT * FROM leads; -- Should work
SELECT * FROM prisma_admins; -- Should fail

-- Test as authenticated user (should work)
SET ROLE authenticated;
SELECT * FROM leads; -- Should work
SELECT * FROM prisma_admins; -- Should work if authenticated
```

## Known Limitations & TODOs

### Security
- ⚠️ **RLS policies are permissive** - Simplified for MVP development
- 🔒 **TODO**: Tighten RLS with proper `auth_user_id` matching in production
- 🔒 **TODO**: Add proper multi-tenant isolation (company-level)
- 🔒 **TODO**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC)

### Data
- ⚠️ **No sample data** - Migration 004 skipped (not critical)
- 📝 **TODO**: Add sample data manually if needed for testing
- 📝 **TODO**: Verify all table relationships with test data

### Features
- 📧 **TODO**: Configure Resend email service for actual email sending
- 📧 **TODO**: Test all 7 workflow triggers with real data
- 🔄 **TODO**: Test complete user flows end-to-end

---

## Next Steps (In Order)

### Step 1: Configure Admin User (Now)
```sql
-- Update default admin email
UPDATE prisma_admins
SET email = 'your-email@getprisma.io',
    full_name = 'Your Name'
WHERE email = 'admin@getprisma.io';
```

### Step 2: Test Lead Submission (Today)
- Submit test lead from landing page
- Verify appears in `leads` table
- Test lead approval/rejection in admin panel

### Step 3: Test Admin Authentication (Today)
- Admin signs up via Supabase Auth
- Link `auth_user_id` to `prisma_admins` record
- Verify admin can access protected routes

### Step 4: Integration Testing (1-2 days)
- Test all forms (Lead, HR, Business Leader)
- Test all admin pages (Dashboard, Leads, Positions, Applicants)
- Test email workflows (if Resend configured)
- Test file uploads (CV upload)

### Step 5: Production Deployment (Week 2)
- Deploy frontend to Vercel
- Deploy backend to Render
- Configure production environment variables
- Run post-deployment validation

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Can't connect to database
**Solution**: Check environment variables (SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY)

**Issue**: Admin can't log in
**Solution**: Ensure admin email matches Supabase Auth email, link `auth_user_id`

**Issue**: Lead form submission fails
**Solution**: Check RLS policies, verify anon key has access

**Issue**: Triggers not firing
**Solution**: Check `email_communications` table for logs, verify workflow_stage values

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check migration status
supabase migration list

# Check table structure
supabase inspect db table-stats --linked

# Check RLS policies
supabase inspect db policies --linked

# View database logs
# Supabase Dashboard > Logs
```
