# Public Assets Directory

This directory contains static assets that are copied as-is to the build output.

## Contents:
- favicon.svg - Prisma brand favicon
- robots.txt - SEO configuration

## Note:
Do NOT place images, fonts, or other assets here unless they need to be referenced by absolute URL.
For imported assets (images, etc.), place them in `src/assets/` instead.
