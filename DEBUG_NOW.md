# 🔍 Debug Right Now

## What I see in your screenshot:

✅ **Login successful** - Network shows LOGIN request with 200 OK
✅ **User authenticated** - Your email and UID are in the response
❌ **Still seeing "Acceso Denegado"**
❌ **No console errors** - Auth is working but admin check is failing silently

---

## 🎯 The Problem

The admin check in `AuthContext.tsx` is likely failing to query the `prisma_admins` table, but not throwing an error in the console.

## 🧪 Test Right Now

**In your Network tab** (where you took that screenshot):

1. Look for a request to **`prisma_admins`** in the Name column
2. If you see it, click on it and check the Response tab

**Expected**: Should see a request like:
```
/rest/v1/prisma_admins?auth_user_id=eq.e23845aa...
```

**If you DON'T see this request** → The query is not running (React not re-rendering)
**If you DO see it with error** → RLS policy is blocking

---

## 🔧 Quick Fix - Force Admin Check

**Run this in Console tab** (switch from Network to Console):

```javascript
// Force trigger the admin check
const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser()
console.log('Current user:', user?.id)

// Query admin table
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('prisma_admins')
  .select('*')
  .eq('auth_user_id', user?.id)
  .eq('is_active', true)
  .single()

console.log('Admin query result:')
console.log('Data:', data)
console.log('Error:', error)

if (data) {
  console.log('✅ You ARE an admin! Try hard reload: Cmd+Shift+R')
} else if (error) {
  console.log('❌ Query failed:', error.code, error.message)
  console.log('FIX: Run SQL in Supabase to fix RLS policy')
} else {
  console.log('❌ No admin record found')
  console.log('FIX: Run database/configure_your_admin.sql')
}
```

---

## 🚨 Most Likely Issue

The `AuthContext.tsx` useEffect might not be triggering. Try:

**Hard reload**: Cmd+Shift+R (or Ctrl+Shift+R on Windows)

This will:
1. Clear any cached React components
2. Re-run the AuthContext initialization
3. Trigger the admin check query

---

## 📊 After Running Console Test

Tell me what you see for:
- `Data:` (should have your admin record)
- `Error:` (should be null)

Then I'll know exactly how to fix it!
